# IntershipTask-3
Task 3: Writing Basic SELECT Queries (SELECT, WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN, ORDER BY).

Select all data → Retrieves all rows and all columns from the table.

Select specific columns → Retrieves only the chosen columns instead of the whole table.

WHERE filter → Shows only rows that match a condition (e.g., employees in department 10).

WHERE with AND → Both conditions must be true (e.g., department 10 and salary > 50,000).

WHERE with OR → At least one condition must be true (e.g., department 20 or 30).

LIKE → Finds patterns in text (e.g., names starting with “A”).

BETWEEN → Retrieves rows where a value falls within a range (inclusive).

ORDER BY → Sorts results either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).

LIMIT → Restricts the number of rows returned (e.g., only first 5 results).
